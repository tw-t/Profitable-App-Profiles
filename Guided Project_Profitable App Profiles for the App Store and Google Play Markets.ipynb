    "## Analysing app distribution by genre\n",
    "\n",
    "We have now created frequency tables which displays results for Category and Genre columns for Google Play data set and prime_genre for App Store data set. The frequencies have been transformed in to percentages and sorted in descending order for ease of analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the results from the freqency table generated for the prime_genre column for the App Store data set, we find that the most populated genre is by Games with 58.16%, followed by Entertainment at 7.88%. The genres after the top two all have frequencies that are less than 5%, showing that the market is being dominated by apps geared towards entertainment instead of practicle purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "One possible reason could be that entertainment apps, and gaming apps in particular, are easier to develop, hence are released on to the market in troves. However, our analysis thus far does not account for the number of users each genre of app have, hence if the large quantity of gaming apps only attracts small number of users each, then developing a gaming app will not be compatible with our revenue generating method. We would require further investigation into the spread of user download frequencies to draw more accurate conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another point to be made is that the analysis is conducted on an English free app data set, hence it could be that different genre of games adopt different business strategies, where gaming and other entertainment apps aims to minimize friction to encourage the largest number of user installation by removing inital price barrier, then set up in-app payment features or adopts the ad driven revenue strategy that our company sets out to follow. Productivity apps, on the otherhand, most likely adopts different pricing strategies and are not free apps as we know that out of approximately 6000 English apps in our App Store data set, roughly half are paid apps and therefore dropped from the analysis data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "For genres in Google Play market, the most popular genre by Category column is Family (18.90%) and followed by Game (9.73%); results by Genre column are Tools (8.45%) and Entertainment (6.07%). The spread of frequency of the Google Play Store data set it much less extreme than that of the App Store's, but the top genre is still twice as populated as the second. The pattern between entertainment and productivity apps is less apparent for the android market, but if we interpret Category as the primary genre, and the Genre column as the secondary  genres, then we would find that android apps are more evenly spread across genres, though it would appear entertainment apps are slightly more popluar.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to reiterate that the analysis above are conducted on English free apps for both markets, hence the results might not be applicable to the markets as a whole. But with our current project specification,\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to suggest an app profile for our specification, we would need to investigate the average number of user installs."
